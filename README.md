## Description

The purpose of the Horiseon project was to refactor code to increase accesibility and improve the quality of the underlying code for future readers/coders. All code has been thoroughly reviewed and slightly altered to reflect these changes to allow ease of use and improve the structure of the application. All code and links have been tested for functionality and repairs were made as needed.
